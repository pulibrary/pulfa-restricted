                  <p xmlns="">Toni Morrison was born Chloe Ardelia Wofford in Lorain, Ohio in 1931. She attended
                     Howard University, graduating in 1953 with a degree in English, then received an MA
                     in literature from Cornell University in 1955.
                  </p>
                  <p xmlns="">After a brief teaching stint at Texas Southern University, Morrison returned to teach
                     at Howard in 1957. There, she married architect Harold Morrison, with whom she had
                     two sons, Harold Ford Morrison (born 1961) and Slade Kevin Morrison (1964-2010). The
                     two divorced around the time of Slade’s birth, after which Morrison began working
                     as a textbook editor for a division of Random House based in Syracuse, NY. In 1967,
                     Morrison was promoted to senior editor and moved to New York City, where she worked
                     with a number of emerging influential African-American writers, including Toni Cade
                     Bambara, Angela Davis, Henry Dumas, and Gayl Jones, in addition to editing <span class="italic">The Black Book</span> (1974), a compilation of African-American historical documents.
                  </p>
                  <p xmlns="">Morrison’s first novel, <span class="italic">The Bluest Eye</span>, was published in 1970. She has published a total of eleven novels to date, winning
                     numerous literary and cultural awards including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for
                     <span class="italic"> Beloved</span> in 1988, the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1993, the National Humanities Medal in
                     2000, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. In addition to her novels, Morrison
                     has written non-fiction, poetry, children’s literature (in collaboration with her
                     son Slade), and dramatic works.
                  </p>
                  <p xmlns="">In 1983, she left her position at Random House to concentrate on writing and teaching,
                     serving as the Albert Schweitzer Professor of the Humanities at SUNY Albany from 1984-1989,
                     then the Robert E. Goheen Professor in the Council of the Humanities at Princeton
                     University until her retirement in 2006. During this time, she taught classes in creative
                     writing, African-American studies, and, at Princeton, developed the interdisciplinary
                     Atelier program. She has also served as a visiting professor and lecturer at numerous
                     institutions, including Yale University, the University of Michigan, the University
                     of Chicago, and Harvard University.
                  </p>
                  <p xmlns="">Morrison currently resides in the Hudson Valley of New York State.</p>

                                    <p>Toni Morrison has required the Library to make surrogate copies of all of her manuscripts
                                       (including typescripts and proofs) and diaries (appointment books), including but
                                       not restricted to those damaged by fire in 1993. This is for conservation reasons,
                                       to prevent damage and deterioration by repeated use. Researchers are required to use
                                       digital surrogates in the reading room of the Department of Rare Books and Special
                                       Collections.
