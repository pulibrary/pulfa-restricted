                                    printed versions. Notepads are identified by their first lines, though a single notepad
                                    may contain a variety of material, including material relating to other works, correspondence
                                    drafts, and other unrelated notes. Corrected typescript and printout drafts often
                                    show significant revisions. Material from various stages of the publication process
                                    is present, including setting copies with copy-editor's and typesetter's marks, galleys,
