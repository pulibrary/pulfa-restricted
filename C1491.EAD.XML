Yellow legal notepads contain notes, early draft material, and inserts for later typed and printed versions. Notepads are identified by their first lines, though a single notepad may contain a variety of material, including material relating to other works, correspondence drafts, and other unrelated notes.

Material from various stages of the publication process is present, including setting copies with copy-editor's and typesetter's marks, galleys, page proofs, F&amp;Gs (folded and gathered pages not yet bound), blueline proofs ("confirmation blues"), advance copies (bound uncorrected proofs) and production/design material with page and dust-jacket samples.</p>
