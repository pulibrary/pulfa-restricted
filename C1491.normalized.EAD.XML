                    <p>Consists of research material, notes, outlines, drafts, galleys, and proofs. Yellow legal notepads contain notes, early draft material, and inserts for later typed and printed versions. Notepads are identified by their first lines, though a single notepad may contain a variety of material, including material relating to other works, correspondence drafts, and other unrelated notes. Corrected typescript and printout drafts often show significant revisions. Material from various stages of the publication process is present, including setting copies with copy-editor's and typesetter's marks, galleys, page proofs, F&amp;Gs (folded and gathered pages not yet bound), blueline proofs ("confirmation blues"), advance copies (bound uncorrected proofs) and production/design material with page and dust-jacket samples.</p>
